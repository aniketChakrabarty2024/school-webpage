<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students  under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory. <br>
I studying in school <font face="algerian" color="blue">CHALTIA SREEGURU PATHSALA HIGH SCHOOL (HS)</font>. It is the best ever school in our vicinity. The beautiful building of my school welcomes us every day. My school has wide airy and excellent classrooms. We have a large open ground to play in our school. Our school has a small garden as well. The school is completely neat and tidy. The entire school staff is kind and motivated.<br>
This school is not the million bricks, but the thousand hearts who carry more dreams than the night sky has stars. This school is the emotions, our stories and our love for each other. I hope you can see that through the stress filled haze this thing  called adulthood has you smoking. We aren't the product, we are the reason.

  <ul>
    <li>Creativity, innovation, and a desire to challenge the status quo will affect what and how we teach and the intellectual ambitions of the university itself.

    <li>Social engagement should orient students' academic experiences to help them become critically engaged citizens, dedicated to solving problems and contributing to the public good.
    </li>
    <li>The New School must embrace these principles and innovate to address shifts in the global economy, society, and environment that require individuals to grapple with complex problems, pursue more fluid and flexible career pathways, and collaboratively create change.

<td><font face="garamond" size="5">For many, school life is a preparatory stage that helps prepare us for the later stages in life, but that learning stays with us for our lifetime. So through the medium of speech I would like to send across a message to all the parents to send their child to a good school and never undermine its importance.
It is at school that I learn so much. I learn so many different subjects. There are many interesting co-curricular activities too. I also participate in extra-curricular activities like music, dance, art, craft and plays. I also get the opportunity to take part in sports and games on the sports grounds at school. I am part of the schools volleyball team. Our teachers teach us with a great deal of care and patience, and I am very grateful to the teachers. At school I have many good friends. We study, play and eat together.</font></td>
