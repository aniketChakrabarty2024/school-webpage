As we know physics is that branch of science where experimentation is an integral part of the core subject. Nonetheless the sophistication of the educational laboratory varies from institute to institute.With myriad physics lab equipments manufacturers available around the globe equipping a laboratory is no more a Herculean task. Most of the colleges buy physics apparatus with respect to the curriculum. As per Oxford Advance Learners dictionary definition Physics is the scientific study of matter and energy and the relationships between them, including the study of forces, heat, light, sound, electricity and the structure of atoms.  <br>
One can see that Physics is a vast subject engulfing various disciplines in it and at school level a student is taught fundamentals of all these disciplines. There is a wide range of physics laboratory equipments from the common ones like magnets, pulleys, pendulums, inclined planes, heat lamps, beakers, lenses, glasses, tuning forks, item scales etc to sophisticated ones like spectroscopes, microscopes, electromagnets, voltammeter, potentiometer, etc.</font><br>     </td>

We were able to see this by mixing certain solutions together and observing changes that occurred. The procedure for this experiment included a few different steps. The first steps were to add the nitrate solutions into the lettered parts of the 96-well plate. Once you were done with that, you were supposed to add the sodium solutions to the numbered parts of the 96-well plate, so that the solutions were added together. You were supposed to observe the different reactions occurring. Once you observed each reaction take place, you needed to fill out your data table.

Students can find any information that they desire with the help of a computer. Almost every school nowadays has a computer lab of their own. Such labs are quite imperative in educating the children about the wise and efficient use of the computer. Children can learn to make various subject related researches using the computer; also they can use it to make various projects in school.

Gym must be situated close enough to ones house. Gym must also be affordable to a person. The price of the membership depends on the quality of equipment, location, staff and other factors. Everyone must choose what is best for them. Besides working out, gyms also offer group aerobics classes, swimming lessons, yoga classes, etc. Some gyms even offer rock climbing, boxing, basketball, dance-based work outs . 0ur school gym is very beautiful. one might even forget that he is in the gym.</font><br>   </td>

A great deal of research has concluded that play-based learning is genuinely and positively impactful on student learning and development. Kathryn Hirsh-Pasek, a well-known child development expert in the Department of Psychology at Temple University and a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues that humans learn best when at least one of these four pillars are present:<br>
Individuals take an active role in the learning environment,
They are engaged,
Information is meaningful,
Learners interact in a social context<br>




This means that children learn well when they are mentally active, engaged, social, and can make meaningful connections to their lives, which are all characteristics of play.</font><br> </td>
